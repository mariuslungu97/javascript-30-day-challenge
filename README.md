Challenge which involves coding a mini-project / day using Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.
Through participating at this challenge, I gathered new valuable experience on how to think like a programmer and solve problems independently.
The following list contains a little description of each project:

Day 1
-you can play custom sounds based on your keyboard input or your click.
